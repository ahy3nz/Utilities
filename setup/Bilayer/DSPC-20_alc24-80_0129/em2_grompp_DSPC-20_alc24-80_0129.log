GROMACS:      gmx grompp, VERSION 5.1.2
Executable:   /usr/local/gromacs/bin//gmx
Data prefix:  /usr/local/gromacs
Command line:
  gmx grompp -f em2.mdp -c em1_DSPC-20_alc24-80_0129.gro -p DSPC-20_alc24-80_0129.top -o em2_DSPC-20_alc24-80_0129.tpr -maxwarn 1


Back Off! I just backed up mdout.mdp to ./#mdout.mdp.4#

NOTE 1 [file em2.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.

Setting the LD random seed to 2056787742
Generated 222 of the 1653 non-bonded parameter combinations
Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 1
Generated 168 of the 1653 1-4 parameter combinations
Excluding 2 bonded neighbours molecule type 'DSPC'
Excluding 2 bonded neighbours molecule type 'alc24'
Excluding 2 bonded neighbours molecule type 'SOL'
Coupling 2688 copies of molecule type 'system'
Removing all charge groups because cutoff-scheme=Verlet
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 27423.00

WARNING 1 [file em2.mdp]:
  You are using full electrostatics treatment PME for a system without
  charges.
  This costs a lot of performance for just processing zeros, consider using
  Cut-off instead.


Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.11
